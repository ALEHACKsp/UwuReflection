# UwuReflection

for game: Blue Reflection

small wip for practicing reversal on an apparent ECS and internal c++ hack stuff, implements a dx11 hook and draws in present with imgui

random implemented kinda stuff

draws esp circles and positions on entities - mostly working, although non-main character npcs have strange Z positions and I'm not currently occluding entities behind the player

ghetto no clip - more or less working, use spacebar to move up

free cam - not working, when the camera is in rail mode its *really* on a rail, this'll have to wait til I find and reverse the function responsible for controlling the cameras world position

setting player position - works, but needs ui code

buncha debug info
